GamesmanPlusPlusBrainstorm
==========================

Introduction
------------

Please post your wish list here. This is almost free association. Whatever comes to mind as something you might want Gamesman to do, put it here! Reserve judgment until *AFTER* the brainstorm is complete. I'll get it started! Please come back a number of times and see if you have anything to add. Don't worry if there's some duplication. I'm going to weed through this later.

The goal is to make sure that all this fits in the model, and that Gamesman++ will be able to (eventually) handle everything we might want to do
