REMINDERS/HOMEWORK
------------------

0. Next week we'll meet in 405 Soda (mark your calendars)

1. Sign up for sourceforge/download cygwin

(CVS instructions) <http://gamescrafters.sourceforge.net/developers/cvs-general.html>  

Remember you need to use your real name for the sourceforge account. If you really don't want to do that, at least put your first name and last initial, like "Dan G."

Our sourecforge website is: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gamescrafters/>

2. Find a partner to work with. We may allow a few groups of 3 for harder    problems.

3. Figure out what you want to work on (for more information email the   team leads)

Team leads

-   Gui: Sean Carr (seancarr@gmail.com)
-   Retro: Eudean Sun (eudeansun@berkeley.edu)
-   Architecture: Dan Garcia (ddgarcia@cs.berkeley.edu)
-   New Games: Yanpei Chen (ychen@berkeley.edu)
-   Documentation: Cynthia Okita (ciokita@berkeley.edu)

4. Play games and get to know the rules, how they work, etc.

5. Study picture dan will post and remember everyone's names

6. Do all the things listed in my 'welcome' email if you haven't.

a) ...register for the course this coming spring, \*2 units\*:

-   CS 98 (002) for Fr/So, CCN = 26374
-   CS198 (002) for Jr/Sr, CCN = 26605

b) ...read the following documents

-   GAMESMAN overview (5 pages)

   http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/software/gamesman/GamesmanGoNC.pdf

-   My MS Thesis on GAMESMAN (~100 pages, but it's an easy read)

   http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/software/gamesman/GAMESMAN.pdf

c) ...install the GAMESMAN software

   You'll need X windows (default on Unix boxes, you have to install    it from the OS install disks on Macs, and you need cygwin for PCs),    Tcl/Tk (www.tcl.tk), and ImageMagick (get the rpms for Linux, fink    for Macs, ?? for PCs -- you know you have it when you have the    executable 'convert'). Then go to the web site below and follow the    directions. Send me mail to add you as a developer.    http://gamescrafters.sourceforge.net/developers/cvs-general.html and

d) ...make note of the mailing list information below

-   GamesCrafters@nim.cs.berkeley.edu

<!-- -->

-   The mailing list for  Game Theory Student Researchers (GamesCrafters)
-   This list is availble on the World Wide Web at:

<http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/aliases/GamesCrafters>

-   Removal? Additions? Questions?
-   Send to GamesCrafters-request@nim.cs.berkeley.edu

e) ...make note of our 2006Sp meeting times: M 5-7pm in 606 Soda    (There's an additional mtg from 7-9pm for architects, who are    senior members of the team. If you *really* want to know how the    system works and contribute to its design, you're welcome to stay    for that meeting. That choice is up to you.)    Since Monday the first week of the semester is a holiday, the first    meeting will be on the Monday of the second week, 2006-01-23 @ 5pm.

MEETING MINUTES
---------------

GamesCrafters, 5-9pm, 2006-01-23 @ 5-9PM

1. Played Games

2. Sign in sheet-name, major, year, relevant courses

3. Pictures

4. Solved Games:

<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solved_board_games>

-   We want to be able to solve games in the strong sense and find efficient ways to do the database

5. Projects to work on:

-   People use our database on-line from the web. Examples: SOAP
-   Gamesman, has an interesting feature that allows you to deal with big games in that you can save it to a file. Right now you need a computer big enough to load the entire database into an array. Goal: Other computers use our database that we saved on our server
-   Solve a game by incrementally writing to a file.

6. Using more than one computer to solve a game (Seti@home)

7. Gui and text

-   Front end is different, same solver

<!-- -->

-   When will it solve? when you are playing against a computer.

<!-- -->

-   Problem with the system: do not have the ability to encode a large game. Those who program with Python or scheme know about Big Ints. C has a Big Int library, but it is not fully integrated into the system. -Gold, silver and bronze: gold means it is a new gui, silver is old api (example: Connect 4)

8. Chess: Nalimov Endgame Tablebases

-   Bottom half of chess solved: all five piece endings and some six piece endings are available to use

<http://www.lokasoft.nl/uk/tbweb.htm>

9. CHEAT: chess endgame automative tutor

-   Load the tablebase from someone else (think google should be working on solving end game databases)

<!-- -->

-   so how do you ping the database? There is a server that lets you put in a piece by putting in a in string that describes the board. You can use this to drive gamesman - no one knows visualization: we can visualize these moves! (example: use the mac chess interface to show the arrows)

<!-- -->

-   Value move: (In stoplight colors) This shows it the value of moving to that position; Red: means that you will lose; Unfortunately, value moves do not show you how much you will win by

<!-- -->

-   Win By: Some games you can win by X amount, including Go, Othello, and Mancala. Want to put this in the system

<!-- -->

-   Mate in: How long till you finish the game. Examples: Chess- if you have a king, rook and a rook against a king, you will mate easily. But if one of your moves gives a rook away, it will be harder to mate even though you still have a winning move. 10. Thinking percentage for gui

11. Berlekamp: Bagh Chal

-   <http://www.baghchal.org/>
-   <http://www.ganse.org/baghchal/bc_init.html>
-   <http://www.ludoteka.com/baghchal-en.html>

<!-- -->

-   Rules: There are 4 tigers trying to capture five of the 20 goats. The board is a 25 point grid with connecting lines. Tigers capture goats by leaping over them. Goats, to protect themselves, surround the tigers and make them unable to move. The game is played in two phases. In the first phases, the goat is placed on any vacant spot. Goats cannot change their position until the last goat is placed on the board. In phase two, after the last goat is placed, goats may move to an open, adjacent spot. Tigers can move to any free point adjacent position along the lines.
-   Do not know at what point you stop playing the game.

12. Variants and analysis

-   Problems on website: do not know what variants are

13. The groups and what they do

-   G\_ui: Deals with interface:
-   R\_etro: fix old games (text and gui), add gui to existing

text game; add symmetries, add movetostring, Add GPS, better hash!, big games (bagh chal)

-   A\_rchitecture: databases, hash functions, think about the

system + what is important; solvers, databases

-   N\_ew Games: program in C, GenerateMoves, DoMove, Primitive?, Hash
-   D\_ocumentation: wikipedia, variable rules, history (last stop

web page), rules in general, C code doc stuff

Team leads with approximate number of people interested.

-   G: Sean ~4
-   R: Eudean  ~4
-   A: (Dan & ?) ~13
-   N: Yanpei  ~10
-   D: Cynthia ~2
