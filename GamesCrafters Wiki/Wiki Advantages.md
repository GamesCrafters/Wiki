Wiki Advantages
===============

-   Automatic notification of updates/changes
    -   user can specify "watched" pages and receive email when there are updates
    -   [RSS Feed of recent changes](http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/wiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&feed=rss)
    -   [Sean Carr RSS Feed link (Correct)](http://www.seancarr.net/gcwiki/index.php?title=Special:Recentchanges&feed=rss)
-   Monitor what individual students are working on
    -   Each student has their own page which can be used to post progress and ideas as well as a personal TODO list
-   Collaborate effeciently on new projects/ideas in a very transparent way (for the rest of the group). Anyone else can catch up by reading the page. More of a trail than email.
-   Easily accessible anywhere with internet access
-   Easily searchable
-   Notes which Dan(or anyone) types in during meeting can go directly into wiki so students can access them in one centrilized location
