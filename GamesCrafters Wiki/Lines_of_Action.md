Status

The text based version is playable and has been strongly solved for a 4x4 board.

History
-------

Lines of Action is a two-player abstract strategy board game invented by Claude Soucie. It was given wider publicity and play when Sid Sackson included it in his book *A Gamut of Games*. The game has not been played for very long so a deep understanding of it is not yet known. We hope to change this by strongly solving the game.

Rules
-----

Lines of Action is played on a traditional chessboard between two players, White and Black. The board's initial setup has the black pieces along the top and bottom row of the board and the white pieces along the left and right most columns of the board. The corners are empty. The goal of the game is to move your pieces so that they are all connected. Two pieces are connected if they are one square apart. Diagonals are included. The other rules are:

1.  Black moves first.
2.  Players take turns moving.
3.  Each turn a player can move one of his/her pieces in a straight line exactly as many squares as there are pieces of either color anywhere along the line of movement. (These are the Lines of Action).
4.  Pieces may jump over pieces of their own color.
5.  Pieces may not jump over pieces of the other color, but they can capture those pieces by landing on them.
6.  If one player is reduced by captures to a single piece, that is a win for the captured player.
7.  If a move simultaneously creates a "win" for both the player moving and the opponent, the player moving wins.

Strategy
--------

The game is not yet widely played so there have been few attempts to gain a very deep understanding of the game. That being said, the general strategy is to try and move your pieces to the center of the board while blocking as many of your opponents lines of action as possible. Capturing an opponent's pieces is generally not a good idea as it reduces the number of pieces they must have connected in order to win.
