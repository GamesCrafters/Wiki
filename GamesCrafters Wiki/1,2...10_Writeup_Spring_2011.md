1,2...10\_Writeup\_Spring\_2011
===============================

-   ''' 1,2...10 Writeup Spring 2011 '''

Process
=======

I first learned the code base of GamesmanMobile and tested my knowledge by starting to write 1,2...10. After I became comfortable, I was able to finish 1,2...10 and get VVH working. I also worked to improve the layout of connect 4 so that the board was easier to see and use. Towards the end of the semester, I began working to create Peg Solitaire but this project still needs a lot of work.

Bugs present/fixed
==================

-   connect 4 layout
-   VVH not working with back button

General Code Structure of 1,2...10: (2 classes)
===============================================

-   board (hard coded table with 10 rows)
-   game (hard coded solver that calculates move values)

Final Product
=============

1,2...10 works as a game and can be used as a teaching tool for new Gamescrafters members. Looking over this simple game will help people understand the code a lot faster than looking over connect 4.

Future Development
==================

1,2...10 does not have database connection. This should be added to help as a teaching tool.
