LoopyTierSolver\_Writeup\_Fall\_2011
====================================

Project Overview
----------------

### Goal

-   To build a loopy tier solver that can solve games that are loopy, tier, and a mix of both. It should be able to solve games such as Nine Men's Morris and Dragons and Swans.

### Members

Mark Edwards, Xiang Cheng, Sung Roa Yoon, Ayush

-   **Mark Edwards** Tried to put the different codes together to make them function, read various solvers to decide which format would be the best to be used and how.
-   **Xiang Cheng** Read up on numerous documents on hadoop to try fully understanding it.
-   **Sung Roa Yoon** Tried to design a new way to make the solver operate, so that the loopy and the tier parts flow well.
-   **Ayush** Tried to assist in all parts of the code, learning things from each and trying best to help all of them.

### Progress

We put basic pieces of codes together from various solvers, and it requires the last link between the loopy and the tier mapreducers that were not completed.
