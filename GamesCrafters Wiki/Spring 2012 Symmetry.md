Spring 2012 Symmetry
====================

About the Project
-----------------

### Description

Most games have some form of symmetry, such as rotation, horizontal reflection or vertical reflection. The symmetry tools provided will allow solvers to determine a 'base state' for each board, and thus eliminate unnecessary computation if a symmetrical version of the board has already been processed.

### Goals

-   Find fixed points for square and rectangular boards
-   Create utility class for rotating to the base state
-   Document all code

### Members

To-Do
-----

-   Use fixed point calculations and minimize computational overhead for rotateToBaseState

Done
----

-   Document code
-   Fixed point calculations
-   naive rotateToBaseState implementation
    -   Implemented square and rectangular boards

Future Work
-----------

-   Implement fixed points for Y-board
-   Implement fixed points for 9 Men's Morris board
