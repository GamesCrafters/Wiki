Game function libraries
=======================

Part of the "refactoring" of the Gamesman engine, the game function libraries will include common functions for use in any of the game modules. In particular, the libraries will aim to provide support for Primitive, DoMove, and GenerateMoves, though only the first one will be attempted this semester. The ultimate goal is to make writing game modules easier by providing common code that can be modified and optimized all at once.

The files associated with the libraries are mlib.c and mlib.h, in the gamesman/src/core directory.
