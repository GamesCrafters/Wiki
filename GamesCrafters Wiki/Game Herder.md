Game Herder
===========

-   68 is the final number, I want that everywhere
-   Edit website
-   Edit XGamesman.new
-   6mm,9mm ==&gt; 369mm "3,6,9 Men's Morris"
-   Fix XGamesman so that has ALL the GUI ones : gold + silver + bronze (36?)
-   Screenshots for all games that work! (all but 3 games, topitop, paradux, pentago)
    -   Ask web team or anyone else for help with the 100x100 gif thingy
    -   Take a normal screenshot, in photoshop (RGB mode), squash, then convert to gif (get help for this)
