IGamesman Writeup Fall 2011
===========================

Project Overview
----------------

### Goals

There were two primary goals for the project this semester. The first was a major overhaul of the UI/UX of the application, developing a much cleaner experience and application flow. The second was an equally major revision to the underlying API that each game must fulfill to run in the iGamesman system.

### Members/Tasks

-   **Kevin Jorgensen** acted as team lead and was responsible for the redesign of the application's UI and the new definition of the game API.
-   **Ian Ackerman** ported the game Connections from the old system to the new API.
-   **Jordan Salter** ported the game Connect-4 from the old system to the new API.
-   **Luca Weihs** ported the game Othello from the old system to the new API.
