Max\_Presentation\_Notes
========================

This is a recording of the responses to Max's 2 minute presentation on Tier Gamesman, in order to prepare him for his poster session on 2006-11-16.

-   yanpei: don't talk about how Gamesman was developed, that wastes time

<!-- -->

-   eudean: he seemed too rushed
-   david: Don't mention monopoly, use othello, chess, etc

<!-- -->

-   ken: start off slower, will seem more relaxed, confident.

Don't talk about background after the first minute.

-   david: for the formal presentation, go a bit more into background, but not in 2-min version

<!-- -->

-   dan: mention that you didn't do the whole thing, you inherited a bunch of code

that code looked at a game as a whole. "my contribution": rethink the entire process, games can be treated as smaller interconnected pieces. Can solve those pieces independently, less memory requirements.

-   sean: split the pieces up, solve independently, -&gt; bigger games

<!-- -->

-   dan: We can now parallelize, crash halfway through and recover

<!-- -->

-   deepa: spend a few minutes coming up with a very simple intro, few sentences

`   **then write down bullet points for your presentation`
`   **end on a takeaway of future plans`
`   **start with approach`
`   **middle is a bit of detail`

-   yanpei: you have a lot more help than other presenters, relax

<!-- -->

-   dan: write a powerpoint slide that has everything you want to say in the 2-min version. do the 5-min by doing 2-min first, then go into details

<!-- -->

-   eudean: choreograph the entire 2-min presentation if you want

<!-- -->

-   dan: write 7+/-2 bullet points with all of your content, emphasize fewest words per bullet

<!-- -->

-   deepa: have a takeaway sentence, for the last few seconds

<!-- -->

-   dan: describe who you are and what you did. Make your contribution clear
