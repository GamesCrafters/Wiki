Title of Project: Python Puzzles

Participants: Chayut, York

Problem: Our goal is to solve simple puzzles with a solver and extend the solver to include more cases.

Solution: We wrote code in python to represent different puzzles. These puzzles were then solved by the solver written by Dan, which tells us the correct steps and results. Another part of this project was to produce a possible web interface through javascript.

Results: The hard results can be seen with the solutions that are available.

Lessons Learned: In the future, we would suggest that more planing should occur in the beginning. This way, the project can proceed in a more orderly fashion and will be easier for bookkeeping purposes.
