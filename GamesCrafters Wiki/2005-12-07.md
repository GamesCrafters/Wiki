==========

-   add [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) and [mantis bug tracking system](http://www.mantisbt.org/) to gamescrafters.berkeley.edu (on OCF)

<!-- -->

-   add Alpha-Beta pruning (solve rest on the fly, or solve-ahead)
    -   play from disk with huge databases

<!-- -->

-   what do we store for every position?
    -   fixed number of bits for values (why?)
    -   what if we know how many bits are needed
    -   rethink bitfields in database (use a hash of some sort to save bits)
    -   save bits to encode empty spaces in position space (relative pointer to next position?)
