POSTER INFO

-   Go to 406 Cory
-   Find Madeline Leullier
-   Find the maximum printing height for the plotter (plotter cannot print edge to edge).
-   Be sure to print on the plotter in 90 deg rotated mode (so width is unbounded).
-   Use GC poster template (make sure the height matches the max printer height).
-   Get a poster board of the appropriate size.
-   Bring your Powerpoint file on a USB key to Madeline. You may wish to email her to make sure she'll be there (she likes to swim during lunch).
-   Make sure she knows to charge it back to GamesCrafters dept acct. You can do this by giving her Cindy's email address (Cindy is Dan's admin -- give her a heads up too).
-   Use spray adhesive to mount the printed poster on the poster board.
