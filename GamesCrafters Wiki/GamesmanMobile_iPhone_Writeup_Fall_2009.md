About the Project
-----------------

### Goal

The primary goal of this project was really a proof of concept - to get the iPhone/iPod Touch to talk to our server and get game database values. For simplicity, I wrote a version of Connect-4 (simple, because the framework was already in place for retrieving game values). Furthermore, I strove to make the program as generic as possible, so that additional games could be added to the app relatively quickly.

### The Author

The project was written entirely by Kevin Jorgensen, with the exception of a JSON parsing utility (see below for details). I also served as the team lead for the GamesmanMobile project, whose goal was to produce a version of Gamesman for the iPhone and a version for the Android. As team lead, I frequently discussed design ideas with the Android team and sought to make the two versions as similar in feel as possible.
