General Information
-------------------

The Gamesman Checklist is an ongoing project to format Gamesman project documentation in a clean and efficient wiki format. The goal is to make creating documentation on the wiki as simple as possible. Adding documentation should be as easy as filling in the blanks of a paper form.

Implementation
--------------

The Gamesman Checklist has been implemented entirely in wiki template code. Adding a single game name to the checklist table inside athe correct template tag automatically creates the color coded table entry.
