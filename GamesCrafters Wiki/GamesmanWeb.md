GamesmanWeb
===========

GamesmanWeb provides the glue between our various backends (namely GamesmanClassic and GamesmanJava) and our (mostly) thin-client Javascript guis. Right now, the only computer running GamesmanWeb is nyc.cs.berkeley.edu. Unfortunately, most members of Gamescrafters do not have access to nyc to test their code. Ideally, developers would run GamesmanWeb locally to get things working before notifying someone with access to nyc to update the server. Unfortunately, setting up GamesmanWeb locally is something of a chore. Here are instructions for setting up GamesmanWeb on a Windows machine.
