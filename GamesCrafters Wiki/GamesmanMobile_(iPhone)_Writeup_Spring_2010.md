About the Project
-----------------

### Goals

We had two goals for iGamesman this semester:

-   "Librarify" the app as much as possible to enable modular addition of additional games
-   Start to work on two new games for the app: Y and Connections.

### Members/Tasks

The two new members to this team first learned the basics of Cocoa Touch and iPhone application design.

-   **Kevin Jorgensen** acted as team lead and Cocoa expert and was responsible for producing an API that every game in the system must support. He also made improvements to the Connect-4 game developed in the Fall 2009 semester.
-   **Linsey Hansen** wrote a version of the game of Y that worked in unsolved play.
-   **Arturo Wu Zhou** wrote the game Connections for unsolved play
