1.  About the project

Description
===========

The objective of this project was to make an interface that future students can use to effectively write their games without worrying about the details of the screen size, options, and various different abstraction barriers that would be annoying to deal with and hard to notice.

Goals
-----

-   Make the infrastructure

<!-- -->

-   Make all the options available

<!-- -->

-   Make sure the game writers are behind enough levels of abstraction that they can write a game as if they are writing it for their personal use.
