Mobile Web Formatting Writeup Spring 2011
=========================================

-   ''' Mobile Web Formatting Writeup Spring 2011 '''

Overview
========

Our project was to make the website (particularly the games) look nicer on mobile devices, especially the iPhone. The first few weeks of the semester were spent getting familiar with both Javascript and the existing GamesmanMobile code. By week four, we had a nice version of connect four on the iPhone which was nice to look at and didn't require any zooming to play. After week four, we began fixing the things that Dan gave told us to at the first check-in. We also attempted to work on other games, but this is a work in progress. We have yet to commit some of the code this code since it is not final.

Bugs present/fixed
==================

-   Visually unpleasing website on mobile devices
-   Zooming in to play games no longer a problem

Future Development
==================

A standardized model for games on the website such that when accessed on a mobile device, switch to a mode that is nice to look at on the mobile device, something like m.gamescrafters.berkeley.edu.
