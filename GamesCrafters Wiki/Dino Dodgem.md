Dino Dodgem

I created a terminal based version of the game Dodgem out of inspiration from trying it out early in the semester. The game was created in Python and features a rather unintelligent AI. I was hoping to improve the AI, but ran out of time. The game takes a users input and proceeds alternate between the user and computer making moves on the board. The game logic wasn't very hard but setting up the internal game itself took longer. The code can be found at [1](https://github.com/zoopreme/dino_dodgem). To run the game just type in terminal: python dino\_dodgem.py

I hope to further improve the AI and also try to make use of python guis so the game looks more appealing.
