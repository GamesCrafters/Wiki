New\_Game\_Interfaces

**Summary of Semester**

-   Worked on creating new structure for play now games
-   New front page interface was implemented with new graphics to represent game types
-   Helped other members in the group learn JavaScript and create new game interfaces
-   Created class for games that involve jumping pieces and began to add games to the new interface
-   I would like to continue adding games and perfect the looks of everything that we created this semester so it can start being used and promoted as our new interface.
