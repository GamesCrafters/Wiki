Improve Web Front-end
=====================

Project Description:

-   For this project I improved the front end of the gamescrafters web pages
-   Adjust the layout of the home page
-   Apply the Foundation Styling to the startGame.html so that the page looks better and consistent with the home page
-   Fix the bug of the setting buttons when playing the game. Now setting button can direct users back to the startGame page to change settings
-   Improve the navigation bar a little bit so that user can not click gamescrafter logo to go back to the home page

Possible Improvements:

-   May add a button in the startGame page so that user can go back to the game they were playing
-   Design and implement some sort of messages indicating that the game is over and enabling the user to play again or go back to the settings or home page
