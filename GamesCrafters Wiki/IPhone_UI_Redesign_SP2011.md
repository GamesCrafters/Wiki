IPhone\_UI\_Redesign\_SP2011
============================

The iPhone UI Redesign was a Spring 2011 project by Peter Tsoi. During this semester, the goals of the project were loosely defined; but the general premise of the project was to propose a new look and feel for the front-end client on the iPhone.

### Acknowledgements

The previous iPhone client is the result of the works of others and lead by Kevin Jorgensen. While I started fresh, I often referenced the old code base and at times, directly copied from the previous version.

Specifically, I worked on a new front-end for Connect-4, which was originally implemented in Fa2009 see [GamesmanMobile.md](GamesmanMobile.md "wikilink") for more information.
