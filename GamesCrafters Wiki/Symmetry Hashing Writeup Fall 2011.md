Symmetry Hashing Writeup Fall 2011
==================================

Overview
========

Worked on a way to compress solved game database via exploiting board symmetries. Still a work in progress. Expected completion sometime in the Spring Semester. Initial work on the project started at dividing a gameboard into partitions, and then searching for the asymmetrical positions for each partition. For example we may a board such as

Initially worked on code that found all asymmetrical positions in an unordered way. It could hypothetically find only the position with the lowest energy state,
