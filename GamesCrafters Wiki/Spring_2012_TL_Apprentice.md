Spring\_2012\_TL\_Apprentice
============================

About the Project
-----------------

To inherit and further develop the body of knowledge that current TL David Spies possesses.

### Description

In anticipation of David's upcoming move to graduate school, Lewin and I have volunteered to learn as much as possible from David in order to carry on his accumulated knowledge regarding the Solver team.

### Goals

-   Understand overall structure of programs deployed by Solver Team
-   Learn ideas behind and methods of executing parallel-processing for solving large games

### Members

-   [David\_Huang.md](User:Pathfinder "wikilink")

### Done

-   As I had been taking CS61B concurrently and had not taken CS61C yet, I had trouble comprehending most of the information initially. This improved as the semester went on. I will stay in touch with David to further inquire about his implementations where necessary.
