Web Interface
=============

Projects (rough)
----------------

-   Rest Interface
    -   Standard data structure (XML?)
-   Browser GUI
    -   HTML / JavaScript / AJAX
-   Game Ports
    -   Port games to standard format so they can be accessed by any client (through REST or other interface)
    -   Move away from tcl/tk
