Introduction
------------

**Gamesman** â€“ Game-independent Automatic Move/position-tree Exhaustive-Search, Manipulation and Navigation Gamesman is and has been at the core of the Gamescrafters project. Originally written by Dr. Dan Garcia, Gamesman has provided a C-based framework for the expression of abstract strategy games, allowing them to be solved, analyzed, and played. Through the years, Dan and his Gamescrafters have expanded Gamesman, developing various modules for solving and analyzing games as well as adding a plethora of games to the system. Gamesman has been an incredible piece of software, but much of its expansion was not and could hardly have been planned for. As a result, its expansibility is becoming limiting and cumbersome. **Gamesman 2.0** is an effort to rethink the design of Gamesman from top to bottom to make it the best software for two-person abstract strategy game theory research, analysis, and application. This document will outline the goals and propose solutions and features for the revamped system. Future documents will go into further detail regarding the actual design of the system, broken down by feature.
