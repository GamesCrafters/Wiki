Parallel\_Dispatcher
====================

To Do
-----

-   Speedup instead of efficiency
-   Check your code in gamesman/java/src/edu/berkeley/gamesman/parallel
-   Have a GREAT usage string
-   Write it up well
-   Find a machine with 8 cores and a game that is optimal and see whether you can EVER get all 8 cores running (e.g., Quarto!)
