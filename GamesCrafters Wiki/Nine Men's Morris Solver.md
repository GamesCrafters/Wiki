Checkpoints
===========

-   Start with a scaled down problem to get a better understanding of the solving interface (say a tic-tac-toe solver).
-   Once we have implented a basic solver, take the next step up and solve a basic version of Nine Men's Morris, such as 3 Men's Morris.
-   Once we have completed an implementation of 3 Men's Morris, we can attempt to tackle something more ambitious since we ought to by that point have an adequate understanding of both the solver as well as the machinations of 9 Men's Morris.
-   Based on assessment from previous point, we can either focus on a 6 Men's Morris or jump straight to an implementation of 9 Men's Morris.
-   Provided 9 Men's Morris goes off without a hitch, we could explore the possibility of allowing the user to specify whether or not he/she wants to play one of the early variations of 9 Men's Morris we should have already solved. This would hopefully not be too difficult to achieve with the solver we've put together for 9 Men's Morris.

To Do
=====

-   Understand Tiering
-   Assess necessary complexity of the hash function (and establish a means of hashing)
