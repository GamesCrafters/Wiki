==========

Good news!
----------

1. We made the cover of the EECS research Summary 2006! The Gamesman interface is on the front! :)

-   Thanks to everyone who helped out during the meeting to get the new interface on the cover! We went from 20 to 35 games in 4 hours!
-   Check out the screenshots in the sourceforge site, or just launch gamesman/bin/XGamesman !!

2. Awarded a $12,000 grant to make possible a new course collaboration with UC Berkeley graphics (UCBUGG), Art department, and Pixar Inc.

-   Prerequisites: one semester in UCBUGG, Art 172, CS 184 = 30 people can take this.

REMINDERS/HOMEWORK
------------------

0. Let's see if we fit in 606 soda for the 2006-02-06 mtg, since some students have left and I've closed enrollment.

1. Waitlisted?

-   if you are waitlisted or cannot get in, register for CS 199. This is also appropriate if you are an EECS honor student and need research units -- GamesCrafters research counts!

Dan wants everyone registered by Monday so we can put this issue to rest.

2. Get Gamesman working: if you need help, ask one of the archs.

-   Known Problems:
    -   Make errors Tcl/Tk
    -   SF Key
    -   Gold Problems (image magic?)

Are these all fixed? Can architects jump on these if not?

Installing the GAMESMAN software

You'll need X windows (default on Unix boxes, you have to install it from the OS install disks on Macs, and you need cygwin for PCs), Tcl/Tk (www.tcl.tk), and ImageMagick (get the rpms for Linux, fink for Macs, ?? for PCs -- you know you have it when you have the executable 'convert'). Then go to the web site below and follow the directions. Send me mail to add you as a developer. http://gamescrafters.sourceforge.net/developers/cvs-general.html

3. Sign up for GamesCrafters if you have not already done so

4. Sign up for sourceforge/download cygwin

(CVS instructions) <http://gamescrafters.sourceforge.net/developers/cvs-general.html>  

Remember you need to use your REAL NAME for the sourceforge account. If you really don't want to do that, at least put your first name and last initial, like "Dan G."

Our sourecforge website is: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/gamescrafters/>

5. Join a group, tell the group lead what you are doing, have a clear proposal by the next meeting.

6. If you're an architect, you need to read the following:

-   How to solve games using 10,000 machines

      <http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html>

-   How to solve 9-Men's-Morris

      <http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/gasser.pdf>

-   How to create chess endgames

      <http://www.msri.org/publications/books/Book29/files/stiller.pdf>

7. Check out "Zillions of Games", which seems to have tapped the user community: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zillions_of_games> (see the links at the bottom of the page too)

MEETING MINUTES
---------------

GamesCrafters, 5-9pm, 2006-01-30 @ 5-9PM 405 Soda

Note: The minutes are a bit incomplete b/c I was out taking pictures

1. Pictures

2. Attendance

3. Announcements (see good news above)

4. Game theory tutorial

See the "introduction to game theory" talk at: <http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/inside/software/downloads/ABriefIntroductionToGameTheory.ppt>

Data types: 1. Vertex = position 2. Edge = move 3. Leaf =primitive position 4. Value=one0f (Win,Lose,Tie,Undecided)

Three big procedures: GenerateMoves(P)-&gt;list of M (movelist) DoMove(P,M)-&gt;P Primitive(P)-&gt;V

    DetermineValue(P)->V
    {
      seenLose=seeTie=False;
      if((V=Primitive(P))!=undecided)
        Return(V);
      else{
        mlist =GenerateMove(P);
        foreach m in mlist {
          V=DetermineValue(DoMove(P,M));
          If (V==Lose) seenLose=True;
          If(V==Tie) seenTie =True;
        }
        if(seeLose)return(win);
        elseif(seenTie)return(Tie);
        else return (lose);
      }
    }

See: gamesman/src/core/solvestd.c

5. Database: every position has a number associated with it. Every board position gets hashed into a number.

-   What do I know about a position?
    -   Value
    -   Remoteness
    -   WinBy (Othello, mancala)
    -   Grundy Number (impartial games only)
        -   \[read more in: <http://www.cut-the-knot.org/ctk/May2001.shtml>\]
        -   \[or: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sprague-Grundy_theory>\]

(from Dan's 2005 Email):

Subject: Our hash functions: injections but not (nec) surjections

<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Surjection.html>

<http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Injection.html>

domain is boards

range is numbers

Hash functions are injections because they map distinct objects (boards) to distinct objects (numbers). If two boards are different, their hashed values are different.

Hash functions are NOT surjections (and thus, not bijections) because there may exist numbers in our hash space that do not correspond to valid boards.

"Perfect" hash functions are those that actually ARE bijections, from a combinatorial point of view. That is, all the numbers between 0 and MAX\_NUMBER\_OF\_POSITIONS-1 actually correspond to boards that could be possible combinatorially.

6. Field width (how many do I care about)

Value: 2,3 or 4 (win/lose, win/lose/tie, win/lose/tie/undecided)

Remoteness: variable

WinBy: Game Specific

Grundy: variable

The way we currently do it: 8 bits for remoteness; store a Grundy number: reserve 5; visited is 1;

Value: 2-&gt;so have 16 bit integer

WinBy is not in there! (project: put WinBy in there)

Problem: For every single game, all 16 bits are stored for every position, even if it is not seen (broken). You store 16 bits whether it is a Grundy value or not. If it is more then 8, produces an error. If it is 8, does not adeptly move. Visited is stored in your file: Want this dynamically. This is dumb code.

When do you stop?

-   need to visit everyone. So when hit everyone, then you are done.
-   When no more positions point to the primitive set.

Vertices and Edges:

Max |E| =|V|^2

7. Draw Loopy (king vs. king in a chess game)

8. Project: find longest remoteness that is not a draw. Help Dan write a paper. Wants to code it up and test it. See: <http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/papers/OpenPositions.html>

-   Illustration: If you want to kill someone and you are walking on a cliff. Would you rather have someone who is a perfect walker or someone who is drunk?

9. Achi answer key: visualization of values (see 'intro to game theory')

Outer Rim: position

Next level: values of moves to that position

Recursive image

Project: think of visualizations for the game tree

10. Game Theory:

Simplify game/value

-   store turn in position

Each position is .. (for player whose turn it is)

-   Winning (there exists a losing child)
-   Losing (all children winning)
-   Tieing (There does not exist a losing child, but exists a tieing child)
-   Drawing (cannot force a win or be forced to lose) example: if exist a L child, then I am a winning position. The move to that losing child is a winning move.

Primitive: bottom of the tree (leaves). Game 1..10: if game is @ 10, it is a losing position because moving to 10 is a winning move.

draw: if all the options are lose move or can move back and forth and not lose what would gamesman do?

--Coding: kloopy=TRUE (will use a different solver)

--Picks the one that mates the fastest

They even sell the TB (tablebase) on DVD!!
