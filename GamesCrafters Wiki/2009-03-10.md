Notes from Monday, 2/2/2009

I. Presentation of solved 5x5 Connect-Four. Game 1: Dan looses on first move. Game 2: Dan demands to play first, forfeits match. Game 3: Dan looses on second move. Game 4: Dan ties with the solver, regains his honor.

II. Presentation of CS3 Gamesman GUI Demo with the game Surround. 1. Windows open side-by-side. 2. Working scrollbar for visual value history. 3. Move backtracking works (But vvh scrollbar dos not resize to match). 4. Animated pieces.

III. Presentation of CS3 Othello Discussion 1. 4x4 Othello problem: Takes too long to solve (About 30 minutes). 2. Dan suggests clipping the dimensions for student testing, then running the full game after everything works. 3. Slowdown probably because of loopiness and non-optimized STk.

IV. Work on Web Interface Connect-Four 1. Compilcations on generic web GUI. Using a strong framework to support nice animations, but it is very specific to Connect-Four. 2. Concurrency problems with Rubik's Cube. 3. GUI works best on browsers in this order: Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer.

V. Presentation of Python Connecct-Four 1. Super powerful more-than-just-a-front-end to the Java libraries. 2. Has access to all of the Java classes and interprets bytecode. 3. Very helpful with debugging Java Connect-Four.
