About the Project

### Description

The status-quo implementations of the games depicted in GamesmanMobile are abysmally disorganized. There is no set standard or unified template that programmers follow to write games for the Android. Because the expansion of the number of games that are added to GamesmanMobile for the Android will inevitably increase as the years go by, debugging and comprehending past games will become exponentially harder because every programmer is using his/her own method of implementation without any definitive template.
