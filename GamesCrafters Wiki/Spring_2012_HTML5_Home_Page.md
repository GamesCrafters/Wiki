Final Writeup
-------------

-   Overall, I achieved what I wanted to this semester. I created a clean front page where you can chose which game you wish to play in a simple way. I tried many different ways of making the games scroll horizontally and ended up using a short but effective function that wrapped around the items in the HTML body. Next semester, I really want to work to combine this with each game so they will actually link correctly and people will play. I also want to work with possibly scrolling around continuously like the current iPhone app does.
