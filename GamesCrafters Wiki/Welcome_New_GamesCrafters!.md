Welcome\_New\_GamesCrafters!
============================

Gamescrafters,

David here. Hope everyone’s having a nice long weekend. I haven’t got the mailing list set up yet (hopefully in the next day), but I wanted to disseminate this information before too much time passed .

First and foremost, Alan’s and my e-mails, in case you have any questions: Alan: alanr@berkeley.edu David: depoll@berkeley.edu

Next, the webpage and wiki: <http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu> (webpage) <http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/wiki> (wiki)

For Wednesday, please have an idea of what groups you’d like to be in. Here’s a reminder (for more details, see the wiki) of the groups: Documentation Architecture Maximization Nice Games Bugs ODeepaBlue Retro Graphics

As a reminder, here are the things you should do by/for wedensday: -Choose a group (and think about a project partner) -Add a “profile” page on the wiki (your user page) with a paragraph or two about yourself. If you’re having trouble, e-mail me or Alan. -Sign up for a sourceforge account (http://www.sourceforge.net) and e-mail me with your user name so that I may add you to the project -Read dan’s 5-page paper (http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~ddgarcia/software/gamesman/GamesmanGoNC.pdf) -Don’t forget to bring your laptop next week… we’ll be setting up computers so that you can run gamesman on your own machine! (If you want it on your desktop, instructions for enlisting are on the wiki) -Ask your friends to join! It’ll be great fun!

Anyhow, it was great to see everyone at the meeting on Wednesday. E-mail me or Alan if you’ve got any questions, and happy gaming! See you Wednesday at 6,

Thanks, David
