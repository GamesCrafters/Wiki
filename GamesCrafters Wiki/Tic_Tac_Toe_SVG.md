Tic\_Tac\_Toe\_SVG
==================

### Overview

During this semester we finished a program that can create a answer key of Tic Tac Toe recursively in a SVG file. The program is implemented in python. The way we implement the program is that we use a game tree to simulate the Tic Tac Toe game and at the same time output the SVG code to record the corresponding game status. The colors we used for the winning , draw, losing moves and the gray background follows the standard of the GamesCrafter. The size of all the squares should be kept in the same ratio but the thickness of the cross and the circle can be modified in the future.
