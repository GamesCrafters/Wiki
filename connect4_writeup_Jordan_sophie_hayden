Game: Connect 4
Group Members: Sophie Yoo, Hayden Koerner, Jordan Knox

Our group began the implementation of the GUI for Connect 4. We began by writing out pseudo code for the game logic of Connect 4. After we were able to clearly visualize the game and the pieces we needed, we first began creating the 5x7 game board through formatting a grid. We were also able to create the game tokens as red and blue circles that fit inside the grid of the gameboard. The last thing we were able to complete was implementing the clickable areas on the board. As of now, each of the columns on the gameboard are highlighted so if a column is selected a token will appear in the column. Next time we wish to correctly format the placement of the tokens so that when a column is selected they are automatically placed on the appropriate square. For Connect 4, the appropriate square would have to be the lowest square in the column that is not currently occupied by a token. We also need to implement the hinting system and how/where we would like hints to appear on or around the board. Our goal is to implement the 5x7 Connect 4 GUI in a way that it can be easily translated to the other available board dimensions.
